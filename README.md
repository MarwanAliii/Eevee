As electric vehicles grow in popularity, we realized that many EV users struggle with finding compatible charging stations and navigating the complexities of charging station availability, costs and maintenance. We noticed that the information about EV charging stations is scattered across different apps, making it difficult for users to access everything they need in one place. This inspired us to create a simple and user-friendly platform that brings all the essential features together to make charging EVs easier and more convenient. 

## What it does

**Overview**

Eevee is a smart and user-friendly app designed to completely change the EV charging experience by eliminating the hassle of finding compatible chargers. When users first join the app, they create an account and input their car's make and model. Eevee automatically identifies the plug type and charger compatibility, provides real-time updates on charger statuses, including availability, maintenance schedules, and timestamps for the most recent updates.

**Community-Powered Updates**

Eevee leverages a crowdsourced approach to ensure the most accurate and up-to-date information about charging stations. Much like Waze, Eevee relies on its community of users to provide real-time updates on the status of chargers. When a user charges their EV, they can report the condition of the station—whether it’s functional, in use, broken, or under maintenance. These reports are aggregated, and as more users confirm or update the status of a charger, the app adjusts its display to reflect the most reliable information. If a station is reported as broken or under maintenance multiple times, it’s flagged on the map to alert other drivers. 

**Intelligent Trip Planning**

Eevee integrates directly with your EV’s battery State of Charge (SoC) data to monitor range and recommend charging stops as needed. If a planned destination exceeds the vehicle’s range or passes through areas with sparse charger density, the app proactively adjusts to optimal charging points along the route and includes the estimated charging time in your trip’s ETA. This intelligent trip planning ensures you’ll never be caught off guard by a low battery.

**Unified Payments**

A standout feature of Eevee is its unified in-app payment system, allowing users to pay for charging sessions directly through the app. This eliminates the need for multiple apps to access different charging networks, solving one of the biggest frustrations for EV drivers. With secure technology like blockchain for payments and Auth0 for authentication, Eevee makes transactions seamless, reliable, and hassle-free. Users can pull up to any compatible charger, plug in, and pay—all through the app.

**Sustainability and Rewards**

Eevee incentivizes eco-friendly behaviour with a Carbon Points system, rewarding users for charging during off-peak hours, reporting charger statuses, or using renewable-powered stations. Points can be redeemed for discounts, eco-friendly products, or donations to environmental causes. The app also tracks users’ lifetime carbon impact, showing CO₂ saved compared to driving gas-powered vehicles, and providing drivers with tangible metrics of their environmental contribution.
